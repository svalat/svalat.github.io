	abstract = "Most general-purpose processors provide support for memory pages of large sizes, called superpages. Superpages enable each entry in the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) to map a large physical memory region into a virtual address space. This dramatically increases TLB coverage, reduces TLB misses, and promises performance improvements for many applications. However, supporting superpages poses several challenges to the operating system, in terms of superpage allocation and promotion tradeoffs, fragmentation control, etc. We analyze these issues, and propose the design of an effective superpage management system. We implement it in FreeBSD on the Alpha CPU, and evaluate it on real workloads and benchmarks. We obtain substantial performance benefits, often exceeding 30\%; these benefits are sustained even under stressful workload scenarios.",

    abstract = {{With virtualization usage growing, the amount of RAM duplication in the same host across different virtual machines possibly running the same software or handling the same data is growing at a fast pace too. KSM is a Linux Kernel module that allows to share equal anony- mous memory across different processes and in turn also across different KVM virtual machines. Thanks to the KVM design and the mmu notifier feature, the KVM virtual machines aren't any different from any other pro- cess from the Linux Virtual Memory subsystem POV. And incidentally all Guest physical memory is allocated as regular Linux anonymous memory mappings. But KSM isn't just for virtual machines.
The KSM main task is to find equal pages in the system. To do that it uses two trees, one is the stable tree the other is the unstable tree. The stable tree contains only already shared and not changing KSM generated pages. The unstable tree contains only pages that aren't shared yet but that are tracked by KSM.
The content of the pages inserted into the two trees is the index of the tree, but we don't want to write-protect all the pagetables that points to the pages in the unstable tree. So we allow the content of the pages (so the tree index) to change under KSM and without knowledge of the tree balancing code. Thanks to the property of the red black trees that can keep a tree balanced without checking the node index value, even if the tree becomes unusable, the tree still remains balanced and the worst case insertion/deletion remains O(log(N)), to guarantee the ksm-tree algorithm not to degenerate in corner cases.
To reduce the number of false negative from the unsta- ble tree lookups, a checksum is used to insert into the unstable tree only pages whose checksum didn't change recently, but in the future the checksum can be replaced by checking the dirty bit of the pagetables and shadow pagetables (not with current EPT though). After a full
scan of all pages tracked by KSM, the unstable tree is rebuilt from scratch to reset all lookup errors introduced by the pages changing content during the scan.
Whenever KSM finds a match in the stable or unstable tree, it proceeds to write-protecting the pagetables that mapped to the old not shared anonymous page, and it makes them map the new shared KSM page as read-only. If any KVM shadow pagetable was mapping the page, it is updated and write-protected through the mmu notifier mechanism with a newly introduced change\_pte method.}},

@book{ModernOperSys3rd,
    abstract = {{<P style="MARGIN: 0px"> </P>  <P style="MARGIN: 0px"> The widely anticipated revision of this worldwide best-seller incorporates the latest developments in operating systems technologies.  The Third Edition includes up-to-date materials on relevant operating systems such as Linux, Windows, and embedded real-time and multimedia systems.  Includes new and updated coverage of multimedia operating systems, multiprocessors, virtual machines, and antivirus software. Covers internal workings of Windows Vista (Ch. 11); unique even for current publications. Provides information on current research based Tanenbaum's experiences as an operating systems researcher.  A useful reference for programmers.</P>} {For software development professionals and computer science students, <I>Modern Operating Systems</I> gives a solid conceptual overview of operating system design, including detailed case studies of Unix/Linux and Windows 2000.<p>   What makes an operating system modern? According to author Andrew Tanenbaum, it is the awareness of high-demand computer applications--primarily in the areas of multimedia, parallel and distributed computing, and security. The development of faster and more advanced hardware has driven progress in software, including enhancements to the operating system. It is one thing to run an old operating system on current hardware, and another to effectively leverage current hardware to best serve modern software applications. If you don't believe it, install Windows 3.0 on a modern PC and try surfing the Internet or burning a CD.<p>   Readers familiar with Tanenbaum's previous text, <I>Operating Systems</I>, know the author is a great proponent of simple design and hands-on experimentation. His earlier book came bundled with the source code for an operating system called Minux, a simple variant of Unix and the platform used by Linus Torvalds to develop Linux. Although this book does not come with any source code, he illustrates many of his points with code fragments (C, usually with Unix system calls).<p>   The first half of <I>Modern Operating Systems</I> focuses on traditional operating systems concepts: processes, deadlocks, memory management, I/O, and file systems. There is nothing groundbreaking in these early chapters, but all topics are well covered, each including sections on current research and a set of student problems. It is enlightening to read Tanenbaum's explanations of the design decisions made by past operating systems gurus, including his view that additional research on the problem of deadlocks is impractical except for "keeping otherwise unemployed graph theorists off the streets."<p>  It is the second half of the book that differentiates itself from older operating systems texts. Here, each chapter describes an element of what constitutes a modern operating system--awareness of multimedia applications, multiple processors, computer networks, and a high level of security. The chapter on multimedia functionality focuses on such features as handling massive files and providing video-on-demand. Included in the discussion on multiprocessor platforms are clustered computers and distributed computing. Finally, the importance of security is discussed--a lively enumeration of the scores of ways operating systems can be vulnerable to attack, from password security to computer viruses and Internet worms.<p>   Included at the end of the book are case studies of two popular operating systems: Unix/Linux and Windows 2000. There is a bias toward the Unix/Linux approach, not surprising given the author's experience and academic bent, but this bias does not detract from Tanenbaum's analysis. Both operating systems are dissected, describing how each implements processes, file systems, memory management, and other operating system fundamentals. <p>   Tanenbaum's mantra is simple, accessible operating system design. Given that modern operating systems have extensive features, he is forced to reconcile physical size with simplicity. Toward this end, he makes frequent references to the 
Frederick Brooks classic <I>The Mythical Man-Month</I> for wisdom on managing large, complex software development projects. He finds both Windows 2000 and Unix/Linux guilty of being too complicated--with a particular skewering of Windows 2000 and its "mammoth Win32 API." A primary culprit is the attempt to make operating systems more "user-friendly," which Tanenbaum views as an excuse for bloated code. The solution is to have smart people, the smallest possible team, and well-defined interactions between various operating systems components. Future operating system design will benefit if the advice in this book is taken to heart. <I>--Pete Ostenson</I> }},

@book{UnderstandTheLinuxKernel3rd,
    abstract = {{In order to thoroughly understand what makes Linux tick and why it works so
well on a wide variety of systems, you need to delve deep into the heart of
the kernel. The kernel handles all interactions between the CPU and the
external world, and determines which programs will share processor time, in
what order. It manages limited memory so well that hundreds of processes can
share the system efficiently, and expertly organizes data transfers so that
the CPU isn't kept waiting any longer than necessary for the relatively slow
disks.

The third edition of \_Understanding the Linux Kernel\_ takes you on a guided
tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming
tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors
offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work
inside their machine. Important Intel-specific features are discussed.
Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more
than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical
underpinnings of why Linux does things the way it does.

This edition of the book covers Version 2.6, which has seen significant
changes to nearly every kernel subsystem, particularly in the areas of memory
management and block devices. The book focuses on the following topics:

  * Memory management, including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct
memory Access (DMA)

  * The Virtual Filesystem layer and the Second and Third Extended Filesystems

  * Process creation and scheduling

  * Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers

  * Timing

  * Synchronization within the kernel

  * Interprocess Communication (IPC)

  * Program execution

\_Understanding the Linux Kernel\_ will acquaint you with all the inner workings
of Linux, but it's more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what
conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the
challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file
access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. This book
will help you make the most of your Linux system.}},

Nemesis has been designed and implemented to be scalable and efficient both in the intranode communication context using shared-memory and in the internode communication case using high-performance networks and is natively multimethod-enabled. Nemesis has been integrated in MPICH2 as a CH3 channel and delivers better performance than other dedicated communication channels in MPICH2. Furthermore, the resulting MPICH2 architecture outperforms other MPI implementations in point-to-point benchmarks.}},

    abstract = { In this paper we examine the topic of writing fault-tolerant Message Passing Interface (MPI) applications. We discuss the meaning of fault tolerance in general and what the MPI Standard has to say about it. We survey several approaches to this problem, namely checkpointing, restructuring a class of standard MPI programs, modifying MPI semantics, and extending the MPI specification. We conclude that, within certain constraints, MPI can provide a useful context for writing application programs that exhibit significant degrees of fault tolerance. }

abstract="Effective vectorization is becoming increasingly important for high performance and energy efficiency on processors with wide SIMD units. Compilers often require programmers to identify opportunities for vectorization, using directives to disprove data dependences. The OpenMP 4.x SIMD directives strive to provide portability. We investigate the ability of current compilers (GNU, Clang, and Intel) to generate SIMD code for microbenchmarks that cover common patterns in scientific codes and for two kernels from the VASP and the MOM5/ERGOM application. We explore coding strategies for improving SIMD performance across different compilers and platforms (Intel® Xeon® processor and Intel® Xeon Phi{\texttrademark} (co)processor). We compare OpenMP* 4.x SIMD vectorization with and without vector data types against SIMD intrinsics and C++ SIMD types. Our experiments show that in many cases portable performance can be achieved. All microbenchmarks are available as open source as a reference for programmers and compiler experts to enhance SIMD code generation.",

abstract = "Cilk (pronounced “silk”) is a C-based runtime system for multithreaded parallel programming. In this paper, we document the efficiency of the Cilk work-stealing scheduler, both empirically and analytically. We show that on real and synthetic applications, the “work” and “critical-path length” of a Cilk computation can be used to model performance accurately. Consequently, a Cilk programmer can focus on reducing the computation's work and critical-path length, insulated from load balancing and other runtime scheduling issues. We also prove that for the class of “fully strict” (well-structured) programs, the Cilk scheduler achieves space, time, and communication bounds all within a constant factor of optimal. The Cilk runtime system currently runs on the Connection Machine CM5 MPP, the Intel Paragon MPP, the Sun Sparcstation SMP, and the Cilk-NOW network of workstations. Applications written in Cilk include protein folding, graphic rendering, backtrack search, and the ★Socrates chess program, which won second prize in the 1995 ICCA World Computer Chess Championship."

abstract = "The performance of OpenMP applications executed in multisocket multicore processors can be limited by the memory interface. In a multisocket environment, each multicore processor can present a performance degradation in memory-bound parallel regions when sharing the same Last Level Cache (LLC). We propose a characterization of the performance of parallel regions to estimate cache misses and execution time. This model is used to select the number of threads and affinity distribution for each parallel region. The model is applied for SP and MG benchmarks from the NAS Parallel Benchmark Suite using different workloads on two different multicore, multisocket systems. The results shown that the estimation preserves the behavior shown in measured executions for the affinity configurations evaluated. Estimated execution time is used to select a set of configurations in order to minimize the impact of memory contention, achieving significant improvements compared with a default configuration using all threads."

HPC system users often have no guarantee that they will be able to reproduce results at a later point in time, even on the same system---software may have been upgraded, removed, or recompiled under their feet, and they have little hope of being able to reproduce the same software environment elsewhere. We present GNU Guix and the functional package management paradigm and show how it can improve reproducibility and sharing among researchers with representative use cases.",

  abstract={The LHCb Data Acquisition system will be upgraded to address the requirements of a 40 MHz readout of the detector. It is not obvious that a simple scale-up of the current system will be able to meet these requirements. In this work we are therefore re-evaluating various architectures and technologies using a uniform test-bed and software framework. Infiniband is a rather uncommon technology in the domain of High Energy Physics data acquisition. It is currently mainly used in cluster based architectures. It has however interesting features which justify our interest : large bandwidth with low latency, a minimal overhead and a rich protocol suite. An InfiniBand test-bed has been and set-up, and the purpose is to have a software interface between the core software of the event-builder and the software related to the communication protocol. This allows us to run the same event-builder over different technologies for comparisons. We will present the test-bed architectures, and the performance of the different entities of the system, sources and destinations, according to their implementation. These results will be compared with 10 Gigabit Ethernet testbed results.}

abstract="MPI standard offers a set of topology-aware interfaces that can be used to construct graph and Cartesian topologies for MPI applications. These interfaces have been mostly used for topology construction and not for performance improvement. To optimize the performance, in this paper we use graph embedding and node/network architecture discovery modules to match the communication topology of the applications to the physical topology of multi-core clusters with multi-level networks. Micro-benchmark results show considerable improvement in communication performance when using weighted and network-aware mapping. We also show that the implementation can improve communication and execution time of the applications.",

  abstract={The LHCb experiment is preparing a major upgrade, during long shutdown 2 in 2018, of both the detector and the data acquisition system. A system capable of transporting up to 50 Tbps of data will be required. This can only be achieved in a manageable way using 100 Gbps links. Such links recently became available also in the servers, while they have been available between switches already for a while. We present first measurements with such links using standard benchmarks and using a prototype event-building application. We analyse the CPU load effects by using Remote DMA technologies, and we also show comparison with previous tests on 40G equipment.}

  abstract={The CMS experiment at LHC has a very large body of software of its own and uses extensively software from outside the experiment. Understanding the performance of such a complex system is a very challenging task, not the least because there are extremely few developer tools capable of profiling software systems of this scale, or producing useful reports. CMS has mainly used IgProf, valgrind, callgrind and OProfile for analysing the performance and memory usage patterns of our software. We describe the challenges, at times rather extreme ones, faced as we've analysed the performance of our software and how we've developed an understanding of the performance features. We outline the key lessons learnt so far and the actions taken to make improvements. We describe why an in-house general profiler tool still ends up besting a number of renowned open-source tools, and the improvements we've made to it in the recent year.}

abstract = "Geant4 is a toolkit for simulating the passage of particles through 
matter. It includes a complete range of functionality including tracking, 
geometry, physics models and hits. The physics processes offered cover a 
comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, 
a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy 
range starting, in some cases, from 250 eV and extending in others to the TeV 
energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models 
utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for 
optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a 
worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been 
created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and 
implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications 
in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and 
medical physics. "

abstract="Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) is one of the main architectures of today's high-performance server. The key feature of NUMA is the non-uniformity of access latency. Access from a processor to attached memory is faster, and it also reduces the possibility of causing contention on interconnect links and memory controller. Multithreaded programs may experience high memory latency without careful placement of data and thread. Thus, it is necessary to develop a tool to identify and help ameliorate NUMA problems. In this paper, we present a data-centric tool to analyze the performance of multithreaded programs on NUMA architectures and provide advices on how to improve the performance. This paper describes the design and implementation of the tool. The tool is evaluated on Linux using three benchmark applications, and the evaluation shows how this tool helps to identify costly variables and choose optimization methods. The result shows performance improvement of upto 51.92{\%}.",

	abstract="Message-Passing Interface (MPI) has become a standard for parallel applications in high-performance computing. Within a single cluster node, MPI implementations benefit from the shared memory to speed-up intra-node communications while the underlying network protocol is exploited to communicate between nodes. However, it requires the allocation of additional buffers leading to a memory-consumption overhead. This may become an issue on future clusters with reduced memory amount per core. In this article, we propose an MPI implementation built upon the MPC framework called MPC-MPI reducing the overall memory footprint. We obtained up to 47{\%} of memory gain on benchmarks and a real-world application.",

	abstract="Over the last decade, Message Passing Interface (MPI) has become a very successful parallel programming environment for distributed memory architectures such as clusters. However, the architecture of cluster node is currently evolving from small symmetric shared memory multiprocessors towards massively multicore, Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) hardware. Although regular MPI implementations are using numerous optimizations to realize zero copy cache-oblivious data transfers within shared-memory nodes, they might prevent applications from achieving most of the hardware's performance simply because the scheduling of heavyweight processes is not flexible enough to dynamically fit the underlying hardware topology. This explains why several research efforts have investigated hybrid approaches mixing message passing between nodes and memory sharing inside nodes, such as MPI+OpenMP solutions [1,2]. However, these approaches require lots of programming efforts in order to adapt/rewrite existing MPI applications.",

	abstract="With the advent of the multicore era, the architecture of supercomputers in HPC (High-Performance Computing) is evolving to integrate larger computational nodes with an increasing number of cores. This change contributes to evolve the parallel programming models currently used by scientific applications. Multiple approaches advocate for the use of thread-based programming models. One direction is the exploitation of the thread-based MPI programming model mixed with OpenMP leading to hybrid applications. But mixing parallel programming models involves a fine management of data placement and visibility. Indeed, every model includes extensions to privatize some variable declarations, i.e., to create a small amount of storage only accessible by one task or thread. This article proposes an extension to the Thread-Local Storage (TLS) mechanism to support data placement in the thread-based MPI model and the data visibility with nested hybrid MPI/OpenMP applications.",

Therefore, OpenMP runtimes require solid performance from a small number of threads (one MPI task per socket, OpenMP inside each socket) to a large number of threads (one MPI task per node, OpenMP inside each node). To tackle this issue, we propose a mechanism to improve performance of thread synchronization with a large spectrum of threads. It relies on a hierarchical tree traversed in a different manner according to the number of threads inside the parallel region. Our approach exposes high performance for thread activation (parallel construct) and thread synchronization (barrier construct). Several papers study hierarchical structures to launch and synchronize OpenMP threads [1, 2]. They tested tree-based approaches to distribute and synchronize threads, but they do not explore mixed hierarchical solutions.",

We analyzed the performance and power consumption of multithreaded applications in cc-NUMA multicore processors and the experimental results of the PARSEC benchmark suite demonstrated that fine-tuning cc-NUMA multicore architectural parameters such as shared cache geometry and replacement policies can lead to significant performance improvement and energy reduction of multithreaded applications. }

abstract = "Loop scheduling is an important issue in the development of high performance multiprocessors. As modern multiprocessors have high and non-uniform memory access (NUMA) costs, the communication costs dominate the execution of parallel programs. Previous affinity algorithms perform better than dynamic algorithms under non-clustered NUMA multiprocessors, but they suffer heavy overheads when migrating work load under clustered NUMA machines. In this paper, we propose a new loop scheduling policy, hierarchical policy, to improve various affinity scheduling algorithms (AFSs) for clustered NUMA machines. We cyclically distribute the iteration chunks to clusters. When imbalance occurs, the migration of iterations is carried on hierarchically. We use hierarchical policy to improve AFS and modified AFS (MAFS), and we call them Hierarchical AFS (HAFS) and Hierarchical MAFS (HMAFS), respectively. AFS uses a deterministic assignment policy to assign repeated executions of loop iteration to the same processor. MAFS modifies the migration policy of AFS, and reduces the number of synchronization operations. We confirm our idea by running many applications under a clustered NUMA simulator. Our experimental result shows that hierarchical policy reduces the inter-cluster remote memory accesses, decreases the locks to the queues, and effectively balances the work load. We also show that HMAFS is the best choice among these algorithms in most cases."

In order to further improve these techniques, modeling and predicting spatial and temporal I/O patterns of {HPC} applications as they run has became crucial. In this paper we present Omnisc'{IO}, an approach that builds a grammar-based model of the I/O behavior of {HPC} applications and uses it to predict when future I/O operations will occur, and where and how much data will be accessed. Omnisc'{IO} is transparently integrated into the {POSIX} and {MPI} I/O stacks and does not require any modification in applications or higher level I/O libraries. It works without any prior knowledge of the application and converges to accurate predictions within a couple of iterations only. Its implementation is efficient in both computation time and memory footprint.},

	shorttitle = {Mercury},
	abstract = {Remote procedure call ({RPC}) is a technique that has been largely adopted by distributed services. This technique, now more and more used in the context of high-performance computing ({HPC}), allows the execution of routines to be delegated to remote nodes, which can be set aside and dedicated to specific tasks. However, existing {RPC} frameworks assume a socket-based network interface (usually on top of {TCP}/{IP}), which is not appropriate for {HPC} systems, because this {API} does not typically map well to the native network transport used on those systems, resulting in lower network performance. In addition, existing {RPC} frameworks often do not support handling large data arguments, such as those found in read or write calls. We present in this paper an asynchronous {RPC} interface, called Mercury, specifically designed for use in {HPC} systems. The interface allows asynchronous transfer of parameters and execution requests and provides direct support of large data arguments. Mercury is generic in order to allow any function call to be shipped. Additionally, the network implementation is abstracted, allowing easy porting to future systems and efficient use of existing native transport mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Leadership supercomputers feature a diversity of storage, from node-local persistent memory and {NVMe} {SSDs} to network-interconnected flash memory and {HDD}. Memory mapping files on different tiers of storage provides a uniform interface in applications. However, system-wide services like mmap are optimized for generality and lack flexibility for enabling application-specific optimizations. In this work, we present Umap to enable user-space page management that can be easily adapted to access patterns in applications and storage characteristics. Umap uses the userfaultfd mechanism to handle page faults in multi-threaded applications efficiently. By providing a data object abstraction layer, Umap is extensible to support various backing stores. The design of Umap supports dynamic load balancing and I/O decoupling for scalable performance. Umap also uses application hints to improve the selection of caching, prefetching, and eviction policies. We evaluate Umap in five benchmarks and real applications on two systems. Our results show that leveraging application knowledge for page management could substantially improve performance. On average, Umap achieved 1.25 to 2.5 times improvement using the adapted configurations compared to the system service.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, file systems were implemented as part of {OS} kernels. However, as complexity of file systems grew, many new file systems began being developed in user space. Nowadays, user-space file systems are often used to prototype and evaluate new approaches to file system design. Low performance is considered the main disadvantage of user-space file systems but the extent of this problem has never been explored systematically. As a result, the topic of user-space file systems remains rather controversial: while some consider user-space file systems a toy not to be used in production, others develop full-fledged production file systems in user space. In this paper we analyze the design and implementation of the most widely known user-space file system framework--{FUSE}--and characterize its performance for a wide range of workloads. We instrumented {FUSE} to extract useful statistics and traces, which helped us analyze its performance bottlenecks and present our analysis results. Our experiments indicate that depending on the workload and hardware used, performance degradation caused by {FUSE} can be completely imperceptible or as high as -83\% even when optimized; and relative {CPU} utilization can increase by 31\%.},

	abstract = {Checkpoint and Restart ({CPR}) is becoming critical to large scale parallel computers, whose Mean Time Between Failures ({MTBF}) may be much shorter than the execution times of the applications. The {CPR} mechanism should be able to store and recover the states of virtual memory, communication and files for the applications in a consistent way. However, many {CPR} tools ignore file states, which may cause errors for applications with file operations on recovery. Some {CPR} tools adopt library-based approaches or kernel-level file systems to deal with file states, but they only support limited types of file operations which are not sufficient for some applications. Moreover, many library-based approaches are not transparent to user applications because they wrap file {APIs}. Kernel-level file systems are difficult to deploy in production systems due to unnecessary overhead they may introduce to applications that do not need {CPR}. In this paper we propose a user-level file system, {CprFS}, to address these problems. As a file system, {CprFS} can guarantee transparency to user applications, and is convenient to support arbitrary file operations. It can be deployed on applications' demand to avoid intervention with other applications. Experimental results on micro-benchmarks and real-world applications show that {CprFS} introduces acceptable overhead and has little impact on checkpointing systems.},

	abstract = {Fault-tolerance has always been an important topic when it comes to running massively parallel programs at scale. Statistically, hardware and software failures are expected to occur more often on systems gathering millions of computing units. Moreover, the larger jobs are, the more computing hours would be wasted by a crash. In this paper, we describe the work done in our {MPI} runtime to enable transparent checkpointing mechanism. Unlike the {MPI} 4.0 User-Level Failure Mitigation ({ULFM}) interface, our work targets solely Checkpoint/Restart (C/R) and ignores wider features such as resiliency. We show how existing transparent checkpointing methods can be practically applied to {MPI} implementations given a sufficient collaboration from the {MPI} runtime. Our C/R technique is then measured on {MPI} benchmarks such as {IMB} and Lulesh relying on Infiniband high-speed network, demonstrating that the chosen approach is sufficiently general and that performance is mostly preserved. We argue that enabling fault-tolerance without any modification inside target {MPI} applications is possible, and show how it could be the first step for more integrated resiliency combined with failure mitigation like {ULFM}.},

	abstract = {Transparently saving the state of the {InfiniBand} network as part of distributed checkpointing has been a long-standing challenge for researchers. The lack of a solution has forced typical {MPI} implementations to include custom checkpoint-restart services that "tear down" the network, checkpoint each node in isolation, and then re-connect the network again. This work presents the first example of transparent, system-initiated checkpoint-restart that directly supports {InfiniBand}. The new approach simplifies current practice by avoiding the need for a privileged kernel module. The generality of this approach is demonstrated by applying it both to {MPI} and to Berkeley {UPC} (Unified Parallel C), in its native mode (without {MPI}). Scalability is shown by checkpointing 2,048 {MPI} processes across 128 nodes (with 16 cores per node). The run-time overhead varies between 0.8\% and 1.7\%. While checkpoint times dominate, the network-only portion of the implementation is shown to require less than 100 milliseconds (not including the time to locally write application memory to stable storage).},

	abstract = {The current trend of large scientific computing problems is to align as much as possible to a Single Programming Multiple Data (or {SPMD}) scheme when the application algorithms are conducive to parallelization and vectorization. This reduces the complexity of code because the processors or (computational nodes) perform the same instructions which allows for better performance as algorithms work on local data sets instead of continuously transferring data from one locality to another. However, certain applications, such as stencil problems, demonstrate the need to move data to or from remote localities. This involves an additional degree of complexity, as one must know with which localities to exchange data. In order to solve this issue, Fortran has extended its scalar element indexing approach to distributed structures of elements. In this extension, a structure of scalar elements is attributed a ”co-index” and lives in a specific locality. A co-index provides the application with enough information to retrieve the corresponding data reference. In C++, containers present themselves as a ”smarter” alternative of Fortran arrays but there are still no corresponding standardized features similar to the Fortran co-indexing approach. In this paper, we present an implementation of such features in {HPX}, a general purpose C++ runtime system for applications of any scale. We describe how the combination of the {HPX} features and the actual C++ Standard makes it easy to define a high performance {API} similar to Co-Array Fortran.},

Practically efficient type reconstruction and normalization is important for high-quality {MPI} implementations that strive to provide good performance for communication operations involving noncontiguous data. Although it has recently been shown that the general problem of computing optimal tree representations of derived datatypes allowing any of the {MPI} derived datatype constructors can be solved in polynomial time, the algorithm for this may unfortunately be impractical for datatypes with large counts. By restricting the allowed constructors to vector and index-block type constructors, but excluding the most general {MPI}\_Type\_create\_struct constructor, the problem can be solved much more efficiently. More precisely, we give a new O(n log n/log log n) time algorithm for finding cost-optimal representations of {MPI} type maps of length n using only vector and index-block constructors for a simple but flexible, additive cost model. This improves significantly over a previous O(n√n) time algorithm for the same problem, and the algorithm is simple enough to be considered for practical {MPI} libraries.},

The data types represented in {MPI} terms are usually modeled after data types native to the application. If a user does not want to transmit a field from the native data type, the user will sometimes align the {MPI} data type such that there is a gap in the displacement where the omitted field would be. With the resulting {MPI} data type now being non-contiguous, cycles are spent making the data contiguous for transmission and then expanding the data back out on the receiving side. We show that by performing data type fission (the process of segregating the transmitted fields from the non-transmitted fields) and aligning the {MPI} data type accordingly, we can completely eliminate the need to copy data during the packing and unpacking process, which can significantly improve the performance of communication-heavy Single Program Multiple Data applications.},

	abstract = {In modern operating systems, memory-mapped I/O (mmio) is an important access method that maps a file or file-like resource to a region of memory. The mapping allows applications to access data from files through memory semantics (i.e., load/store) and it provides ease of programming. The number of applications that use mmio are increasing because memory semantics can provide better performance than file semantics (i.e., read/write). As more data are located in the main memory, the performance of applications can be enhanced owing to the effect of a large cache. When mmio is used, hot data tend to reside in the main memory and cold data are located in storage devices such as {HDD} and {SSD}; data placement in the memory hierarchy depends on the virtual memory subsystem of the operating system. Generally, the performance of storage devices has a direct impact on the performance of mmio. It is widely expected that better storage devices will lead to better performance. However, the expectation is limited when fast storage devices are used since the virtual memory subsystem does not reflect the performance feature of those devices. In this article, we examine the Linux virtual memory subsystem and mmio path to determine the influence of fast storage on the existing Linux kernel. Throughout our investigation, we find that the overhead of the Linux virtual memory subsystem, negligible on the {HDD}, prevents applications from using the full performance of fast storage devices. To reduce the overheads and fully exploit the fast storage devices, we present several optimization techniques. We modify the Linux kernel to implement our optimization techniques and evaluate our prototyped system with low-latency storage devices. Experimental results show that our optimized mmio has up to 7x better performance than the original mmio. We also compare our system to a system that has enough memory to keep all data in the main memory. The system with insufficient memory and our mmio achieves 92\% performance of the resource-rich system. This result implies that our virtual memory subsystem for mmap can effectively extend the main memory with fast storage devices.},

	shorttitle = {{NVMalloc}},
	abstract = {{DRAM} is a precious resource in extreme-scale machines and is increasingly becoming scarce, mainly due to the growing number of cores per node. On future multi-petaflop and exaflop machines, the memory pressure is likely to be so severe that we need to rethink our memory usage models. Fortunately, the advent of non-volatile memory ({NVM}) offers a unique opportunity in this space. Current {NVM} offerings possess several desirable properties, such as low cost and power efficiency, but suffer from high latency and lifetime issues. We need rich techniques to be able to use them alongside {DRAM}. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for exploiting {NVM} as a secondary memory partition so that applications can explicitly allocate and manipulate memory regions therein. More specifically, we propose an {NVMalloc} library with a suite of services that enables applications to access a distributed {NVM} storage system. We have devised ways within {NVMalloc} so that the storage system, built from compute node-local {NVM} devices, can be accessed in a byte-addressable fashion using the memory mapped I/O interface. Our approach has the potential to re-energize out-of-core computations on large-scale machines by having applications allocate certain variables through {NVMalloc}, thereby increasing the overall memory capacity available. Our evaluation on a 128-core cluster shows that {NVMalloc} enables applications to compute problem sizes larger than the physical memory in a cost-effective manner. It can bring more performance/efficiency gain with increased computation time between {NVM} memory accesses or increased data access locality. In addition, our results suggest that while {NVMalloc} enables transparent access to {NVM}-resident variables, the explicit control it provides is crucial to optimize application performance.},

	abstract = {Using flash-based solid state drives ({SSDs}) as main memory has been proposed as a practical solution towards scaling memory capacity for data-intensive applications. However, almost all existing approaches rely on the paging mechanism to move data between {SSDs} and host {DRAM}. This inevitably incurs significant performance overhead and extra I/O traffic. Thanks to the byte-addressability supported by the {PCIe} interconnect and the internal memory in {SSD} controllers, it is feasible to access {SSDs} in both byte and block granularity today. Exploiting the benefits of {SSD}'s byte-accessibility in today's memory-storage hierarchy is, however, challenging as it lacks systems support and abstractions for programs. In this paper, we present {FlatFlash}, an optimized unified memory-storage hierarchy, to efficiently use byte-addressable {SSD} as part of the main memory. We extend the virtual memory management to provide a unified memory interface so that programs can access data across {SSD} and {DRAM} in byte granularity seamlessly. We propose a lightweight, adaptive page promotion mechanism between {SSD} and {DRAM} to gain benefits from both the byte-addressable large {SSD} and fast {DRAM} concurrently and transparently, while avoiding unnecessary page movements. Furthermore, we propose an abstraction of byte-granular data persistence to exploit the persistence nature of {SSDs}, upon which we rethink the design primitives of crash consistency of several representative software systems that require data persistence, such as file systems and databases. Our evaluation with a variety of applications demonstrates that, compared to the current unified memory-storage systems, {FlatFlash} improves the performance for memory-intensive applications by up to 2.3x, reduces the tail latency for latency-critical applications by up to 2.8x, scales the throughput for transactional database by up to 3.0x, and decreases the meta-data persistence overhead for file systems by up to 18.9x. {FlatFlash} also improves the cost-effectiveness by up to 3.8x compared to {DRAM}-only systems, while enhancing the {SSD} lifetime significantly.},

	abstract = {Persistent key-value stores have emerged as a main component in the data access path of modern data processing systems. However, they exhibit high {CPU} and I/O overhead. Today, due to power limitations it is important to reduce {CPU} overheads for data processing. In this paper, we propose Kreon, a key-value store that targets servers with flash-based storage, where {CPU} overhead and I/O amplification are more significant bottlenecks compared to I/O randomness. We first observe that two significant sources of overhead in state-of-the-art key-value stores are: (a) The use of compaction in {LSM}-Trees that constantly perform merging and sorting of large data segments and (b) the use of an I/O cache to access devices, which incurs overhead even for data that reside in memory. To avoid these, Kreon performs data movement from level to level by performing partial instead of full data reorganization via the use of a full index per-level. In addition, Kreon uses memory-mapped I/O via a custom kernel path with Copy-On-Write. We implement Kreon as well as our custom memory-mapped I/O path in Linux and we evaluate Kreon using commodity {SSDs} with both small and large datasets (up to 6 billion keys). For a large dataset that stresses I/O, Kreon reduces {CPU} cycles/op by up to 5.8x, reduces I/O amplification for inserts by up to 4.61x, and increases insert ops/s by up to 5.3x, compared to {RocksDB}, a state-of-the-art key-value store that is broadly used today.},

Users can define a mapping between the application memory and abstract storage objects, creating a linkage between either all or part of an object's content without data copy or transfer, avoiding explicit management of complex data movement across multiple storage hierarchies.

	abstract = {Emerging high performance computing ({HPC}) systems are expected to be deployed with an unprecedented level of complexity due to a deep system memory and storage hierarchy. Efficient and scalable methods of data management and movement through this hierarchy is critical for scientific applications using exascale systems. Moving toward new paradigms for scalable I/O in the extreme-scale era, we introduce novel object-centric data abstractions and storage mechanisms that take advantage of the deep storage hierarchy, named Proactive Data Containers ({PDC}). In this paper, we formulate object-centric {PDCs} and their mappings in different levels of the storage hierarchy. {PDC} adopts a client-server architecture with a set of servers managing data movement across storage layers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed {PDC} system, we have measured performance of benchmarks and I/O kernels from scientific simulation and analysis applications using {PDC} programming interface, and compared the results with existing highly tuned I/O libraries. Using asynchronous I/O along with data and metadata optimizations, {PDC} demonstrates up to 23× speedup over {HDF}5 and {PLFS} in writing and reading data from a plasma physics simulation. {PDC} achieves comparable performance with {HDF}5 and {PLFS} in reading and writing data of a single timestep at small scale, and outperforms them at a scale of larger than 10K cores. In contrast to existing storage systems, {PDC} offers user-space data management with the flexibility to allocate the number of {PDC} servers depending on the workload.},

	abstract = {Scientific data sets, which grow rapidly in volume, are often attached with plentiful metadata, such as their associated experiment or simulation information. Thus, it becomes difficult for them to be utilized and their value is lost over time. Ideally, metadata should be managed along with its corresponding data by a single storage system, and can be accessed and updated directly. However, existing storage systems in high-performance computing ({HPC}) environments, such as Lustre parallel file system, still use a static metadata structure composed of non-extensible and fixed amount of information. The burden of metadata management falls upon the end-users and require ad-hoc metadata management software to be developed.With the advent of "object-centric" storage systems, there is an opportunity to solve this issue. In this paper, we present {SoMeta}, a scalable and decentralized metadata management approach for object-centric storage in {HPC} systems. It provides a flat namespace that is dynamically partitioned, a tagging approach to manage metadata that can be efficiently searched and updated, and a light-weight and fault tolerant management strategy. In our experiments, {SoMeta} achieves up to 3.7X speedup over Lustre in performing common metadata operations, and up to 16X faster than {SciDB} and {MongoDB} for advanced metadata operations, such as adding and searching tags. Additionally, in contrast to existing storage systems, {SoMeta} offers scalable user-space metadata management by allowing users with the capability to specify the number of metadata servers depending on their workload.},

They consume as much as 10\% of execution cycles on {TLB} misses, even using large pages. On the other hand, we find that these workloads use read-write permission on most pages, are provisioned not to swap, and rarely benefit from the full flexibility of page-based virtual memory. To remove the {TLB} miss overhead for big-memory workloads, we propose mapping part of a process's linear virtual address space with a direct segment, while page mapping the rest of the virtual address space. Direct segments use minimal hardware---base, limit and offset registers per core---to map contiguous virtual memory regions directly to contiguous physical memory. They eliminate the possibility of {TLB} misses for key data structures such as database buffer pools and in-memory key-value stores. Memory mapped by a direct segment may be converted back to paging when needed. We prototype direct-segment software support for x86-64 in Linux and emulate direct-segment hardware. For our workloads, direct segments eliminate almost all {TLB} misses and reduce the execution time wasted on {TLB} misses to less than 0.5\%.},

	abstract = {The number of cores in {HPC} systems and servers increased a lot for the last few years. In order to also increase the available memory bandwidth and capacity, most systems became {NUMA} (Non-Uniform Memory Access) meaning each processor has its own memory and can share it. Although the access to the remote memory is transparent for the developer, it comes with a lower bandwidth and a higher latency. It might heavily impact the performance of the application if it happens too often. Handling this memory locality in multi-threaded applications is a challenging task. In order to help the developer, we developed {NUMAPROF}, a memory profiling tool pinpointing the local and remote memory accesses onto the source code with the same approach as {MALT}, a memory allocation profiling tool. The paper offers a full review of the capacity of {NUMAPROF} on mainstream {HPC} workloads. In addition to the dedicated interface, the tool also provides hints about unpinned memory accesses (unpinned thread or unpinned page) which can help the developer find portion of codes not safely handling the {NUMA} binding. The tool also provides dedicated metrics to track access to {MCDRAM} of the Intel Xeon Phi codenamed Knight’s Landing. To operate, the tool instruments the application by using Pin, a parallel binary instrumentation framework from Intel. {NUMAPROF} also has the particularity of using the {OS} memory mapping without relying on hardware counters or {OS} simulation. It permits understanding what really happened on the system without requiring dedicated hardware support.},

Hardware evolution has made this resource cheap for the past few years. Available memory is now close to a few hundred gigabytes. But the current evolution in the multi/many-core era tends to make some issues come back. The memory available tends not to follow the increasing number of cores making the memory resource per thread rare again. We also encounter new issues with the requirement to manage a bigger space with many more allocated objects. This new aspect increases the probability of memory leaks. It also increases the probability of memory management performance issues. Hence, with {MALT} we provide a tool to track the memory allocated by an application. We then map the extracted metrics onto the source code, just like kcachegrind does with valgrind for the {CPU} performance. Compared to most available tools, {MALT} can also be used to track potential performance losses due to bad allocation patterns (too many allocations, small allocations, recycling large allocations, short-lived allocations...) thanks to the various metrics it exposes to the user. This paper will detail the metrics extracted by {MALT} and how we present them to the user thanks to a nice web based graphical interface which is missing with most of the available Linux tools.},

Such evolutions require more attention to the full memory management chain, particularly stressed in multi-threaded context. Several memory allocators provide better scalability on the user-space side. But, with the steadily increasing number of cores, the impact of the operating system cannot be neglected anymore. We measured performance impact of the {OS} memory sub-system for up to one third of the total execution time of a real application on 128 cores. On modern architectures, we measured that up to 40\% of the page fault time is spent in page zeroing. In this paper, we detail a proposal to improve paging performance by removing the needs of this unproductive page zeroing through an extension of the mmap semantic. To this end, we added a kernel-level memory page pool per process to locally reuse free pages without content reset. Our experiments show significant performance improvements especially for huge pages.},

In the upgraded system, both event building and event filtering will be performed in software for all the data produced in every bunch-crossing of the {LHC}. In order to transport the full data rate of 32 Tb/s, we will use custom field-programmable gate array ({FPGA}) readout boards ({PCIe}40) and the state-of-the-art off-the-shelf network technologies. The full-event-building system will require around 500 servers interconnected together. From a networking point of view, event building traffic has an all-to-all pattern, requiring careful design of the network architecture to avoid congestion at the data rates foreseen. In order to maximize link utilization, different techniques can be adopted in various areas like traffic shaping, network topology, and routing optimization. The size of the system makes it very difficult to test at production scale, before the actual procurement. We resort, therefore, to network simulations as a powerful tool for finding the optimal configuration. We will present an accurate low-level description of an {InfiniBand}-based network with event building like traffic. We will show a comparison between simulated and reduced scale systems and how changes in the input parameters affect the performance.},

	abstract = {{RapidIO} (http://rapidio.org/) technology is a packet-switched high-performance fabric, which has been under active development since 1997. The technology is used in all 4G/{LTE} base stations worldwide. {RapidIO} is also used in embedded systems that require high reliability, low latency, and deterministic operations in a heterogeneous environment. {RapidIO} has several offloading features in hardware, therefore relieving the {CPUs} from time- and power-consuming work. Most importantly, it allows for remote direct memory access and thus zero-copy data transfer. In addition, it lends itself readily to integration with field-programmable gate arrays. In this paper, we investigate {RapidIO} as a technology for high-speed data acquisition ({DAQ}) networks, in particular the {DAQ} system of an {LHC} experiment. We present measurements using a generic multiprotocol event-building emulation tool that was developed for the {LHCb} experiment. Event building using a local area network, such as the one foreseen for the future {LHCb} {DAQ}, puts heavy requirements on the underlying network as all data sources from the collider will want to send to the same destinations at the same time. This may lead to an instantaneous over commitment of the output buffers of the switches. We will present results from implementing an event building cluster based on {RapidIO} interconnect, focusing on the bandwidth capabilities of the technology as well as its scalability.},

The constantly increasing need for more and more bandwidth has initiated the development of commercial 100-Gb/s networks. There are three candidates on the horizon that need to be considered: Intel Omni-Path, 100-G Ethernet, and {EDR} {InfiniBand}. We present test results with such links using both standard benchmarks (e.g., iperf) and a custom benchmark called Data {AcQquisition} ({DAQ}) Protocol Independent Performance Evaluator ({DAQPIPE}). With {DAQPIPE}, we mainly evaluate the ability to exploit the targeted network for a kind of all-to-all communication pattern. The key benefit of these measurements is that it helps us to tune our benchmark and improves our understanding of the relevant parameters.

We efficiently hide the encoding time using one Fault-Tolerance dedicated thread per node. We implement our technique in the Fault Tolerance Interface {FTI}. We evaluate the correctness of our performance model and conduct a study of the reliability of our library. To demonstrate the performance of {FTI}, we present a case study of the Mw9.0 Tohoku Japan earthquake simulation with {SPECFEM}3D on {TSUBAME}2.0. We demonstrate a checkpoint overhead as low as 8\% on sustained 0.1 petaflops runs (1152 {GPUs}) while check-pointing at high frequency.},

	abstract = {The emergence of non-volatile memory {DIMMs} such as Intel Optane {DCPMM} blurs the gap between usual volatile memory and persistent storage by enabling byte-accessible persistent memory with reasonable performance. This new hardware supports many possible use cases for high-performance applications, from high performance storage to very high-capacity volatile memory (terabytes). However the numerous ways to configure the memory subsystem raises the question of how to configure nodes to satisfy applications' needs (memory, storage, fault tolerance, etc.). We focus on the issue of partitioning {HPC} nodes with {NVDIMMs} in the context of co-scheduling multiple jobs. We show that the basic {NVDIMM} configuration modes would require node reboots and expensive hardware configuration. Moreover it does not allow the co-scheduling of all kinds of jobs, and it does not always allow locality to be taken into account during resource allocation. Then we show that using 1-Level-Memory and the Device {DAX} mode by default is a good compromise. It may be easily used and partitioned for storage and memory-bound applications with locality awareness.},

Strict adherence to {POSIX} semantics is known to impede performance and thus several new {PFSs} with relaxed consistency semantics and better performance have been introduced. Such {PFSs} are useful provided that applications can run correctly on a {PFS} with weaker semantics. While it is widely assumed that {HPC} applications do not require strict {POSIX} semantics, to our knowledge there has not been systematic work to support this assumption. In this paper, we address this gap with a categorization of the consistency semantics guarantees of {PFSs} and develop an algorithm to determine the consistency semantics requirements of a variety of {HPC} applications. We captured the I/O activity of 17 representative {HPC} applications and benchmarks as they performed I/O through {POSIX} or I/O libraries and examined the metadata operations used and their file access patterns. From this analysis, we find that 16 of the 17 applications can utilize {PFSs} with weaker semantics.},

Over the past six years, the {LHCb} collaboration has undertaken a bottom-up rewrite of its software infrastructure, pattern recognition, and selection algorithms to make them better able to efficiently exploit modern highly parallel computing architectures. We review the impact of this reoptimization on the energy efficiency of the real-time processing software and hardware which will be used for the upgrade of the {LHCb} detector. We also review the impact of the decision to adopt a hybrid computing architecture consisting of {GPUs} and {CPUs} for the real-time part of {LHCb}'s future data processing.

	doi = {10.1109/IPDPS.2019.00099},
	shorttitle = {{VeloC}},
	abstract = {Global checkpointing to external storage (e.g., a parallel file system) is a common I/O pattern of many {HPC} applications. However, given the limited I/O throughput of external storage, global checkpointing can often lead to I/O bottlenecks. To address this issue, a shift from synchronous checkpointing (i.e., blocking until writes have finished) to asynchronous checkpointing (i.e., writing to faster local storage and flushing to external storage in the background) is increasingly being adopted. However, with rising core count per node and heterogeneity of both local and external storage, it is non-trivial to design efficient asynchronous checkpointing mechanisms due to the complex interplay between high concurrency and I/O performance variability at both the node-local and global levels. This problem is not well understood but highly important for modern supercomputing infrastructures. This paper proposes a versatile asynchronous checkpointing solution that addresses this problem. To this end, we introduce a concurrency-optimized technique that combines performance modeling with lightweight monitoring to make informed decisions about what local storage devices to use in order to dynamically adapt to background flushes and reduce the checkpointing overhead. We illustrate this technique using the {VeloC} prototype. Extensive experiments on a pre-Exascale supercomputing system show significant benefits.},

	abstract = {Large-scale simulations of plasmas are essential for advancing our understanding of fusion devices, space, and astrophysical systems. Particle-in-Cell ({PIC}) codes have demonstrated their success in simulating numerous plasma phenomena on {HPC} systems. Today, flagship supercomputers feature multiple {GPUs} per compute node to achieve unprecedented computing power at high power efficiency. {PIC} codes require new algorithm design and implementation for exploiting such accelerated platforms. In this work, we design and optimize a three-dimensional implicit {PIC} code, called {sputniPIC}, to run on a general multi-{GPU} compute node. We introduce a particle decomposition data layout, in contrast to domain decomposition on {CPU}-based implementations, to use particle batches for overlapping communication and computation on {GPUs}. {sputniPIC} also natively supports different precision representations to achieve speed up on hardware that supports reduced precision. We validate {sputniPIC} through the well-known {GEM} challenge and provide performance analysis. We test {sputniPIC} on three multi-{GPU} platforms and report a 200-800x performance improvement with respect to the {sputniPIC} {CPU} {OpenMP} version performance. We show that reduced precision could further improve performance by 45\% to 80\% on the three platforms. Because of these performance improvements, on a single node with multiple {GPUs}, {sputniPIC} enables large-scale three-dimensional {PIC} simulations that were only possible using clusters.},

	abstract = {The conventional distributed file system is designed for {LAN} environment. They always play poor performance in {WAN}. In this paper we present a novel distributed file system: The Mobile Agent-based Distributed File System ({MADFS}). The objective of {MADFS} is to reduce the overhead of network transfer and cache management inherent to the distribution of a distributed files system in {WAN}. The {MADFS} organizes hosts into a hierarchical structure, and uses mobile agents as the underlying facility for transmission, communication and synchronization. We also present a novel cache coherency mechanism for {MADFS}: hierarchical and convergent cache coherency mechanism ({HCCM}). {HCCM} can effectively reduce the overhead of cache coherency management in distributed file system. In this paper, we also build an analysis model for {HCMM} and compare the performance to single-layer mode. The comparing results show that {HCMM} has better performance in {WAN}. In conclusion, {MADFS} can achieve better performance and availability than conventional distributed file system in {WAN}.},

The file system provides relaxed {POSIX} semantics, only offering features which are actually required by most (not all) applications. It is able to provide scalable I/O performance and reaches millions of metadata operations already for a small number of nodes, significantly outperforming the capabilities of general-purpose parallel file systems.},

	doi = {10.1109/SC.2016.68},
	abstract = {Burst buffers are becoming an indispensable hardware resource on large-scale supercomputers to buffer the bursty I/O from scientific applications. However, there is a lack of software support for burst buffers to be efficiently shared by applications within a batch-submitted job and recycled across different batch jobs. In addition, burst buffers need to cope with a variety of challenging I/O patterns from data-intensive scientific applications. In this study, we have designed an ephemeral Burst Buffer File System ({BurstFS}) that supports scalable and efficient aggregation of I/O bandwidth from burst buffers while having the same life cycle as a batch-submitted job. {BurstFS} features several techniques including scalable metadata indexing, co-located I/O delegation, and server-side read clustering and pipelining. Through extensive tuning and analysis, we have validated that {BurstFS} has accomplished our design objectives, with linear scalability in terms of aggregated I/O bandwidth for parallel writes and reads.},

	abstract = {Memory access bugs, including buffer overflows and uses of freed heap memory, remain a serious problem for programming languages like C and C++. Many memory error detectors exist, but most of them are either slow or detect a limited set of bugs, or both. This paper presents {AddressSanitizer}, a new memory error detector. Our tool finds out-of-bounds accesses to heap, stack, and global objects, as well as use-after-free bugs. It employs a specialized memory allocator and code instrumentation that is simple enough to be implemented in any compiler, binary translation system, or even in hardware. {AddressSanitizer} achieves efficiency without sacrificing comprehensiveness. Its average slowdown is just 73\% yet it accurately detects bugs at the point of occurrence. It has found over 300 previously unknown bugs in the Chromium browser and many bugs in other software.},
