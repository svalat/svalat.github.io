    abstract = { In this paper we examine the topic of writing fault-tolerant Message Passing Interface (MPI) applications. We discuss the meaning of fault tolerance in general and what the MPI Standard has to say about it. We survey several approaches to this problem, namely checkpointing, restructuring a class of standard MPI programs, modifying MPI semantics, and extending the MPI specification. We conclude that, within certain constraints, MPI can provide a useful context for writing application programs that exhibit significant degrees of fault tolerance. }

abstract="Effective vectorization is becoming increasingly important for high performance and energy efficiency on processors with wide SIMD units. Compilers often require programmers to identify opportunities for vectorization, using directives to disprove data dependences. The OpenMP 4.x SIMD directives strive to provide portability. We investigate the ability of current compilers (GNU, Clang, and Intel) to generate SIMD code for microbenchmarks that cover common patterns in scientific codes and for two kernels from the VASP and the MOM5/ERGOM application. We explore coding strategies for improving SIMD performance across different compilers and platforms (Intel® Xeon® processor and Intel® Xeon Phi{\texttrademark} (co)processor). We compare OpenMP* 4.x SIMD vectorization with and without vector data types against SIMD intrinsics and C++ SIMD types. Our experiments show that in many cases portable performance can be achieved. All microbenchmarks are available as open source as a reference for programmers and compiler experts to enhance SIMD code generation.",

abstract = "Cilk (pronounced “silk”) is a C-based runtime system for multithreaded parallel programming. In this paper, we document the efficiency of the Cilk work-stealing scheduler, both empirically and analytically. We show that on real and synthetic applications, the “work” and “critical-path length” of a Cilk computation can be used to model performance accurately. Consequently, a Cilk programmer can focus on reducing the computation's work and critical-path length, insulated from load balancing and other runtime scheduling issues. We also prove that for the class of “fully strict” (well-structured) programs, the Cilk scheduler achieves space, time, and communication bounds all within a constant factor of optimal. The Cilk runtime system currently runs on the Connection Machine CM5 MPP, the Intel Paragon MPP, the Sun Sparcstation SMP, and the Cilk-NOW network of workstations. Applications written in Cilk include protein folding, graphic rendering, backtrack search, and the ★Socrates chess program, which won second prize in the 1995 ICCA World Computer Chess Championship."

abstract = "The performance of OpenMP applications executed in multisocket multicore processors can be limited by the memory interface. In a multisocket environment, each multicore processor can present a performance degradation in memory-bound parallel regions when sharing the same Last Level Cache (LLC). We propose a characterization of the performance of parallel regions to estimate cache misses and execution time. This model is used to select the number of threads and affinity distribution for each parallel region. The model is applied for SP and MG benchmarks from the NAS Parallel Benchmark Suite using different workloads on two different multicore, multisocket systems. The results shown that the estimation preserves the behavior shown in measured executions for the affinity configurations evaluated. Estimated execution time is used to select a set of configurations in order to minimize the impact of memory contention, achieving significant improvements compared with a default configuration using all threads."

HPC system users often have no guarantee that they will be able to reproduce results at a later point in time, even on the same system---software may have been upgraded, removed, or recompiled under their feet, and they have little hope of being able to reproduce the same software environment elsewhere.

  abstract={The LHCb Data Acquisition system will be upgraded to address the requirements of a 40 MHz readout of the detector. It is not obvious that a simple scale-up of the current system will be able to meet these requirements. In this work we are therefore re-evaluating various architectures and technologies using a uniform test-bed and software framework. Infiniband is a rather uncommon technology in the domain of High Energy Physics data acquisition. It is currently mainly used in cluster based architectures. It has however interesting features which justify our interest : large bandwidth with low latency, a minimal overhead and a rich protocol suite. An InfiniBand test-bed has been and set-up, and the purpose is to have a software interface between the core software of the event-builder and the software related to the communication protocol. This allows us to run the same event-builder over different technologies for comparisons. We will present the test-bed architectures, and the performance of the different entities of the system, sources and destinations, according to their implementation. These results will be compared with 10 Gigabit Ethernet testbed results.}

abstract="MPI standard offers a set of topology-aware interfaces that can be used to construct graph and Cartesian topologies for MPI applications. These interfaces have been mostly used for topology construction and not for performance improvement. To optimize the performance, in this paper we use graph embedding and node/network architecture discovery modules to match the communication topology of the applications to the physical topology of multi-core clusters with multi-level networks. Micro-benchmark results show considerable improvement in communication performance when using weighted and network-aware mapping. We also show that the implementation can improve communication and execution time of the applications.",
