			<h3>Code is your second best friend or a meditation temple</h3>
			<p class='meta'>2019</p>
			
			<center><img src='images/P1110409.JPG'/></center>
			
			<p>
				When you are a developer, you might sometimes talk more to your code than to your best
				friend after your wife/husband and childs. If you want making him telling you beautiful
				things, learning your interesting things, opening your mind, maybe you should take care
				of his health.
			</p>

			<p>
				You can make him beautiful and well aligned showing light and make him running over a
				smooth life interacting pacificly with you, breathing slowly. You will see, he will make
				your life better, becoming a great teacher for you, and you for him. If you respect him
				this way, bugs will be an happy leçon it gives to you and enrich him. Your life will be
				peaceful as what you provide to the world. People will be happy to join you in your project
				in the same peace you introduced. If you prefer not seing your code as a person you can also
				see it as a meditation temple, maybe this is a little bit both.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you don't respect your code, just like a child, he will tell you and start to cry
				(segfault), being a rebel and will make your life hard, making your head tired at the end
				of the day and people not so happy to collaborate with you. Beautiful codes are most of the
				time also simple one, you will in this case notice you can with pleasure also work with non
				super-hero people without fear or giving them non-interesting tasks. It opens an inclusive
				development way instead of complex exclusive one. Also always think about the guy who will
				have to maintain it later when you will leave it, try to give him peace.
			</p>

			<p>
				Never neglect the importance of beauty in the world. Beauty comes from your heart.
				Make it coming real and send its light to the world. If you are a developer, the code
				is probably your way, your voice, to tell to the world how you like it, what about you
				are dreaming. Play your peaceful melody even better if you are with other peoples. You
				might not know, you can heal a lot of things doing this.
			</p>

			<p>
				Codes are linked to our real world via the brains of developers and users. This way,
				you can inject peace and hope.
			</p>

			<h3>Code should be poetry</h3>
			<p class='meta'>2018</p>
			<!-- http://chittagongit.com/icon/poetry-icon-13.html -->
			<center><img src='images/poetry-icon-13.jpg'/></center>
			<p>
				You will certainly notice over all those projects the great efforts to make things beautiful,
				unit tested, as safe as I can (at least I tried). This is because I strongly think as computer
				scientist we need to keep in mind things need to stay beautiful even when we open the hood to
				keep pleasure to do things and inspire people looking for your work as it with time comes from
				your heart. In this case, it is also pleasure to share what you are doing in this case. We have
				thousands of years to do things, we should take time to look, think, rethink, do, think, do.
				No stress, no rush before we share publicly. Of course share with people you met around you,
				get their view to enrich yours.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm not a nice French or English writer, many spell mistakes in my documents, but I like nice
				ideas, and I strongly think writing my source codes is like writing poetry. We should do the
				best to make it beautiful, efficient, safe, maintainable. It will probably impact a little bit
				the world we don't know how. At least for sure more than the day-to-day words we pronounce.
			</p>

			<p>
				Think about the guy forgetting to put the buffer size argument to the strcat(), now replaced by
				strncat().... I don't blame him/them, this was when we started to make computer science. We didn't
				know at that time. But how many security holes he/they opened and debugging nightmare he has implied
				in many projects ? What is the world cost, human brain time consumed by this simple line in the .h
				file ? And now it is an API we cannot change anymore because everything use it. Shouldn't have they
				taken one more month to think about this before sharing to everyone ? Shouldn't we be able to take
				a break, think on the issue and change before going forward. If I don't know myself how to do it as
				a computer scientist for virtual things, how I can except Monsanto or others to do it ?
			</p>

			<p>
				On the nicer side, what are the beautiful lessons we can take out from large scale algorithms like
				bittorent, what we develop in High Performance Computing with now millions of cores collaborating
				together. What it says on the way to change and make living our society with lots of peoples interacting
				and thinking together to rethink our society in a sustainable and pleasant way.
			</p>

			<p>
				I learned during my PhD. that local optimization is now doomed in HPC. Only large scale and global one
				has a real value. In this field we know well we cannot pursue looking only on the execution time of one
				line even if, of course, it keeps some meaning. We know we need to think the thing globally to get the
				best. If I translate to my real life, I understand I cannot just optimize my salary, getting a new faster
				phone every year, eating a tomato in winter, googling something without thinking how it impacts the rest
				of the world.
			</p>

			<p>
				I also learned that failing a single line can make everything crashed. What about species we destroyed
				on our interconnected ecosystem ? Forced to admit that on this point it looks that after 2 billion years
				of careful work, nature has made something fairly better than what we do in computers. I understand that 
				execution time is not everything. Finally, I know that if millions processors wait from one what to do,
				it doesn't work. So don't wait about your president to tell how to change, start to do it on yourself and
				your friends to help him and we will se alltogether what to do.
			</p>

			<p>
				Of course far from me the idea to force applying those ideas manually. Inspire peoples with the beauty
				of your work you are good in. Translate in their language what you are doing. Touch their heart. Let them
				think, translate inside themselves, in their own words and maybe, you don't know, reuse and share in their
				own way in their life. Of course it takes time and is outside of our control.
			</p>

			<p>
				Our natural world is collapsing due to things we don't care about and fast worldwide industrialization
				of everything with local optimization before we really know and control the side effects. I'm not in
				politics nor a chemist to reduce environmental pollution, nor an economist to fully understand how crazy
				the finance is.
			</p>

			<p>
				As a computer scientist, in my day to day work I can just try to save brain time to let room and energy
				for people to look more what is so beautiful and need to be protected in our world. I can also help to
				use this beautiful tool to observe and understand the global impact of our technology at the scale of
				our planet. If it is part of the issue, it is also a micro part for the solution and at least it is to
				me a support to question myself, open my mind and my students when I have one.
			</p>

			<p>
				I made lots of home work to improve my own way to develop, not listed here. I'm making a long way
				background thinking on the way we approach source development mostly by doing many projects around
				build system home source distribution to look existing open source projects. You can look on my
				personal project timeline, some are on my GitHub.
			</p>

			<p>
				Hope one day I will be able to academically speak in a structured way on this, side to the technical
				things I make and love.

			<h3>Beautifull things, my best diving pictures</h3>
			<!--<p class='meta'>Dec. 2017</p>-->
			<p>Science is nice but our planet is so beautifull. We miss somthing if we do not share about all those nice things we
			can see during our life. Lets take a short time to look on all those small and essential lifes which are arround us. Let
			them feed our hearts so we can have beautifull ideas and keep in mind we need to protect them.
			</p>
			<p>
			I like scuba diving and took pictures of all those beautifull species we have just at our door in the south of
			france and in our lakes. Here my best pictures. Hope you will enjoy.
			</p>
			<p>No need of a reflex to make those pictures, this is just with a 10 years old Lumix TZ5 and a lot of patience.</p>
